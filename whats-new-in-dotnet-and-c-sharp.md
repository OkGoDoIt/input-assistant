# Recent Updates with C#

## C# 12 Enhancements

**Release Date:** November 2023

### 1. Primary Constructors

**Description:**
Primary constructors, previously exclusive to record types, are now available for all classes and structs. This feature allows you to define constructor parameters directly within the class or struct declaration, streamlining the initialization process.

**Syntax:**
```csharp
public class Person(string name, int age)
{
    public void Deconstruct(out string Name, out int Age) => (Name, Age) = (name, age);
}
```

**Usage:**
```csharp
var person = new Person("Alice", 30);
var (name, age) = person;
Console.WriteLine($"{name}, {age}"); // Output: Alice, 30
```

**When to Use:**
Use primary constructors to simplify class and struct definitions, especially when you have straightforward initialization logic. They enhance code readability and reduce boilerplate code.



### 2. Collection Expressions

**Description:**
Collection expressions introduce a concise syntax for creating collections. They support the spread operator (`..`) to include elements from existing collections.

**Syntax:**
```csharp
var numbers = [1, 2, 3, ..otherNumbers, 7, 8];
```

**Usage:**
```csharp
int[] otherNumbers = { 4, 5, 6 };
var numbers = [1, 2, 3, ..otherNumbers, 7, 8];
Console.WriteLine(string.Join(", ", numbers)); // Output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
```

**When to Use:**
Use collection expressions to create and initialize collections succinctly, improving code clarity and reducing verbosity.



### 3. Inline Arrays

**Description:**
Inline arrays allow the definition of fixed-size arrays directly within structs, providing performance benefits by avoiding heap allocations.

**Syntax:**
```csharp
public struct FixedSizeBuffer
{
    private int[3] _buffer;
}
```

**Usage:**
```csharp
var buffer = new FixedSizeBuffer();
buffer[0] = 10;
buffer[1] = 20;
buffer[2] = 30;
Console.WriteLine(buffer[1]); // Output: 20
```

**When to Use:**
Use inline arrays when you need fixed-size buffers within structs, such as in performance-critical applications or low-level programming scenarios.



### 4. Optional Parameters in Lambda Expressions

**Description:**
Lambda expressions can now define optional parameters with default values, enhancing their flexibility.

**Syntax:**
```csharp
Func<int, int, int> add = (x = 0, y = 0) => x + y;
```

**Usage:**
```csharp
Func<int, int, int> add = (x = 0, y = 0) => x + y;
Console.WriteLine(add());       // Output: 0
Console.WriteLine(add(5));      // Output: 5
Console.WriteLine(add(5, 10));  // Output: 15
```

**When to Use:**
Use optional parameters in lambda expressions to provide default behaviors, reducing the need for multiple overloads or additional logic.


## C# 13 Enhancements

**Release Date:** November 2024

### 1. `\e` Escape Sequence

**Description:**
Introduces the `\e` escape sequence to represent the ESCAPE/ESC character (U+001B).

**Syntax:**
```csharp
string escapeText = "\e[31mHello, Red!\e[0m";
Console.WriteLine(escapeText);
```

**When to Use:**
Use this when working with ANSI escape codes for terminal output formatting.



### 2. Lock Object

**Description:**
Allows performing a `lock` on `System.Threading.Lock` instances, making locking mechanisms more efficient.

**Syntax:**
```csharp
var myLock = new System.Threading.Lock();
lock (myLock)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Thread-safe operation.");
}
```

**When to Use:**
Use this in multithreading scenarios where thread safety is required.



### 3. Partial Properties

**Description:**
Allows splitting a property into multiple parts using the `partial` modifier.

**Syntax:**
```csharp
partial class Sample
{
    public partial int MyProperty { get; }
}

partial class Sample
{
    public partial int MyProperty => 42;
}
```

**When to Use:**
Use this to separate property implementation across multiple files for better code organization.
