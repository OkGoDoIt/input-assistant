# Testing Plan for Windows Realtime Input Assistant

## Overview
This document outlines the testing strategy for the Windows Realtime Input Assistant project. The purpose is to ensure the application remains robust, maintainable, and reliable throughout its lifecycle.

## 1. Testing Framework
- **Framework Chosen:** [xUnit.net](https://xunit.net/)
  - **Rationale:** xUnit.net is a widely adopted, well-documented unit testing framework that integrates seamlessly with Visual Studio, the `dotnet test` CLI, and popular CI/CD systems.

## 2. Project Structure
- **Main Project:** Contains all core application code (e.g., `Program.cs`, `ConfigManager.cs`, etc.).
- **Test Project:** Separate project (`InputAssistant.Tests`) that references the main project. The structure aligns with the main project to maintain clarity.

  **Example Structure:**
  ```
  /InputAssistant
      Program.cs
      ConfigManager.cs
      SpeechToTextService.cs
      KeyboardHookManager.cs
      InputSimulator.cs
      VoiceCommandProcessor.cs
      ScreenshotHelper.cs
      StatisticsManager.cs
  /InputAssistant.Tests
      ConfigManagerTests.cs
      VoiceCommandProcessorTests.cs
      ... (additional test files)
  ```

## 3. Types of Testing

### 3.1. Unit Testing
- **Objective:** Test individual components in isolation.
- **Focus Areas:**
  - **ConfigManager:** Verify default values and proper configuration loading.
  - **VoiceCommandProcessor:** Ensure that diverse inputs are handled without exceptions and that commands are parsed as expected.
  - Expand to other modules such as `SpeechToTextService`, `KeyboardHookManager`, `InputSimulator`, `ScreenshotHelper`, and `StatisticsManager` as their implementations evolve.
- **Approach:** Write small, focused tests that run quickly and do not depend on external systems.

### 3.2. Integration Testing
- **Objective:** Validate that modules interact correctly with one another.
- **Candidates:**
  - Testing the interaction between the speech-to-text service and the keyboard hook.
  - Ensuring that the complete workflow (e.g., hotkey activation leading to transcription and simulated typing) works as expected.
- **Approach:** Use real or mocked dependencies where appropriate to emulate full application behavior.

### 3.3. End-to-End Testing
- **Objective:** Validate overall application behavior from user input to system output.
- **Context:** Currently, the app is a command-line tool, but if a more complex UI or workflow is introduced, consider using automation tools (e.g., Selenium, custom scripts) for E2E testing.

## 4. Running the Tests
- **Command Line:** Use the command `dotnet test` in the solution root to run all tests.
- **Visual Studio:** Utilize the Test Explorer interface for running and debugging tests.
- **CI/CD:** Integrate test execution into your CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps) to run tests automatically on each commit or pull request.

## 5. Code Coverage and Reporting
- **Code Coverage Tools:** Tools like Coverlet or Codecov can be integrated to measure and monitor test coverage.
- **Reporting:** Regularly review test coverage reports to ensure that new changes are sufficiently covered by tests.

## 6. Best Practices
- **Naming Conventions:** Use descriptive test method names that indicate the scenario being tested.
- **Modularity:** Keep tests concise and modular to simplify maintenance.
- **Mocking External Dependencies:** Use mocking frameworks to isolate tests from unreliable external resources (e.g., network calls, hardware interfaces).
- **Documentation:** Document any specific environment setups or assumptions required for the tests (e.g., API key configuration in environment variables).
- **Iterative Improvement:** Start with core unit tests and gradually add integration and E2E tests as functionality grows.

## Conclusion
This testing plan is a living document meant to evolve as the project's requirements and features expand. Future engineers should refer to this guide for setting up, enhancing, and maintaining the testing suite to ensure high software quality.

Happy Testing!
